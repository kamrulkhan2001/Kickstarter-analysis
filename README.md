![Kickstarter](path/to/Kickstarter.png)
Overview of Project: The purpose of the project is to gauge the success of certain kickstarter campaigns and identify correlations between the success rate and other factors such as categories, initial goal of the campaign. 
Analysis and Challenges: The large amount of data requires summarization using Pivot-tables. Determining where to start and which data to filter on is the biggest challenge with a data set this large. Selecting different criterias and filters allows someone analyzing the data to determine what story to tell based on the data. 
Conclusions: Campaigns with goals of less than $1,000 and greater than $50,000 have the highet success rates. Campaigns with goals greater than $50,000 also have the lowest cancellation rate. 
Goals should be set at a moderate amount. 
Other factors like quality of the campaign page iteself and number of large doners itself  has not been taken into consideration. 
If the data was availalbe, a chart showing donors of different sizes would be useful. With the curent data, charts with goals/pledges compairing countries would also be useful.
